Project Status:

Meet Music Man, a conversational AI that recommends you songs based on your music taste and current mood!

We use Cohere's Natural Language Processor to determine how your day went, then suggest the songs you should listen to today based on your musical history on Spotify!

Tech Stack: Python, Flask, Cohere API, spotipy (Spotify's API)

Currently trying to expand the program into a mobile application, utilising technologies like React Native, PostgreSQL, and AWS!
